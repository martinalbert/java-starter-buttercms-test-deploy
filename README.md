# Java Spring Boot +  ButterCMS Starter Project

This Java + Spring Boot starter project fully integrates with dynamic sample 
content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, 
categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented 
search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created 
in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.

[View our live demo hosted at Heroku](https://java-starter-buttercms.herokuapp.com/), or you can click a button below
to deploy your own copy of our starter project to the provider of your  choice.

### 3. Build the project

Alternatively, you can run it directly via the `java` command
